## 1. Public Catalog Endpoints Blocked

If `products.json` returns 401, 403, empty, or unusable data:

- Say the full catalog audit cannot be completed from public endpoints
- Do not estimate product counts or description coverage
- You may still review sampled pages, but downgrade scope to sampled only
- GEO and AEO checks on sampled HTML can still proceed

Phrasing: `The store does not expose usable public Shopify catalog data, so catalog-wide product and collection analysis is not possible from public endpoints alone. Sampled HTML analysis and GEO/AEO checks are still included.`

## 2. Anti-Bot or Rate-Limit Responses

If you encounter 429s, intermittent failures, or bot protection:

- Slow down requests
- Reduce sample breadth if needed
- Do not pretend missing pages were checked

Phrasing: `Some public pages were intermittently blocked by anti-bot or rate-limit behavior, so HTML findings are based on the pages that rendered successfully.`

## 3. JSON-LD Not Visible in HTML

Shopify apps frequently inject JSON-LD client-side (via JavaScript).

If server-rendered HTML does not show JSON-LD:

- Do not declare the store lacks structured data sitewide
- Say it was not visible in sampled server-rendered HTML
- Recommend Google's Rich Results Test for confirmation
- Flag the structured data section with a note about client-side possibility

Phrasing: `Structured data was not visible in the sampled server-rendered HTML. Shopify apps often inject this client-side, so confirm with Google's Rich Results Test before treating it as absent.`

## 4. Incomplete Collection or Page Data

If `collections.json` or `pages.json` is sparse, empty, or inconsistent:

- Say those public endpoints appear limited
- Avoid catalog-wide claims about collection coverage
- Use sitemap and sampled HTML where possible

## 5. Sitemap and Metadata Mismatches

If product counts in `meta.json` and sitemap do not match:

- Note the mismatch as a data quality concern
- Do not assume one source is authoritative
- The mismatch itself is the finding

Phrasing: `The public product count in meta.json does not match the product sitemap count, which makes crawl coverage harder to validate from public data.`

## 6. Blog Detection Edge Cases

If no blog sitemap is present:

- Say `blog or article content not detected from the public sitemap`
- Do not claim the store has no blog at all

If article URLs exist but are hard to sample:

- Keep blog findings sampled and narrow

## 7. llms.txt Detection Issues

`/llms.txt` may return:

- 404 — file does not exist (most common)
- 200 with valid Markdown — file exists and is properly structured
- 200 with HTML — the store redirected to homepage or an error page (not a real llms.txt)
- 301/302 redirect — follow and check final destination

Check the `Content-Type` header. A real llms.txt should be `text/plain` or `text/markdown`, not `text/html`.

## 8. AI Bot Blocking Ambiguity

Shopify controls the default robots.txt for all stores. When AI bots are blocked:

- Distinguish between Shopify's defaults and merchant-chosen rules
- Note that merchants can customize via `robots.txt.liquid` but many do not know
- Mention that Cloudflare may add a second blocking layer beyond robots.txt
- Do not imply the merchant deliberately chose to block AI bots — it is likely Shopify's default

Phrasing: `AI search bots are currently blocked — this appears to be Shopify's platform default. Merchants can customize this via robots.txt.liquid.`

## 9. Review Widget Detection

Third-party review apps (Judge.me, Yotpo, Stamped, Loox) inject via JavaScript. If no review elements are visible in server-rendered HTML:

- Check `<script>` tags for known review platform CDN domains
- Look for placeholder `<div>` elements with review-related IDs or classes
- If nothing found, note that reviews may still exist via client-side injection

Do not say "the store has no reviews" — say "no review widget was detected in the server-rendered HTML."

## 10. How to Phrase Partial-Evidence Findings

Use these fallbacks:

- `Catalog-wide finding unavailable from public data`
- `Sampled finding only`
- `Inference from visible page patterns`
- `Cannot determine from public endpoints — recommend Admin API check`

Avoid when evidence is partial:

- `every page`
- `the whole store`
- `Google can't index this`
- `this is definitely the reason`
